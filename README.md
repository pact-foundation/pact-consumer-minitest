Provides [Pact](https://github.com/realestate-com-au/pact) Consumer support for Minitest.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'pact-consumer-minitest'

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install pact-consumer-minitest

## Usage

See the README for the [pact](https://github.com/pact-foundation/pact-ruby) gem for full instructions on how to use Pact.

To use Pact with Minitest, instead of requiring `"pact/consumer/rspec"`, require `"pact/consumer/minitest"` and include `Pact::Consumer::Minitest` in your spec or unit test.
